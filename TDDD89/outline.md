No Rainbow is a variant of constraint the more general constraint satisfaction problem.
The No Rainbow problem consists of finding a surjective coloring of a r-regular hypergraph.
Using on "Exact Algorithms for No-Raindow Coloring and Phylogenetic Decisiveness"
by Ghazaleh Parvini and David FernaÂ´ndez-Baca as a starting point -- a faster algorithm is suggested.
The algorithm is complete with proofs for correctness and speed show it is faster the previously proposed
solutions.
