# A. What are the main results, or guidelines, of the paper that you read? Provide a summary and give some concrete examples of either what the authors suggest when writing a research paper, or how they themselves formulate research questions and try to answer them.

## Main findings
Genetic algorithms can be used to create controllers which are all the best in some respect. A designer can then pick the controller that most suits their needs.
This new model is called *mood4ct*.

## Research questions

> (1) In this work, a holistic MOO design technique using MOEAs
> is presented for controller tuning purposes.
> In Section II, a review on MOO is given and, in Section III, (1) the MOO approach
> for controller tuning (mood4ct) is presented. (2) In Section IV, an
> engineering application example is developed and experimen-
> tally evaluated and discussed. 

I'd also argue there's an implicit questions (3) "how do we visuallize a large set of potential controllers?"

I find 3 research questions, which I would reformulate to:

  1. How can a holistic MOO design technique look?
  2. How does this holistic MOO design evaluate when used for an actual problem?
  3. How do we visualize a large set of potential controllers?

This structure makes it a bit hard to see what is answered where. The report is
also a bit hard to simply string search in.

The answers the text gives are presented in the conclusion.

  1. They present the model
  2. "With mood4ct, it is possible to achieve a higher degree of flexibility for choosing a solution that matches the desired level of tradeoff between conflicting objectives, such as performance, control ef- fort, and robustness."
  3. "The mood4ct procedure is validated as a tool for de- signing different control architectures."

But almost all sections of the report are given to answer a question.
This gives ample detail. The approach is flexible and a nice way to present the solution.
Since writing out the research questions sometimes feels a bit hamfisted.

The authors answer each question in a different section. Not being limited to questions makes
the report more understandable, since they here present a new method they have invented.

It's also quite sad that the link they provide in the appendix is forbidden.

# B. How can you make use of the results or advice provided by the paper that you read, in order to make an assessment of the tentative research questions in your own team's extended thesis plan introduction? 

I can steal the structure of one section per answer. It would suit my kind of research.
It would probably be better to have clearly stated questions since it's easier to search in.

Clearly stating questions also makes me sleep better at night.
