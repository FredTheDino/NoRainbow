\chapter{Introduction}
The faster something can be done, the faster technology can iterate.
A part of this is finding faster algorithms for known hard problems.
One such hard problem is the no rainbow problem, which is NP-complete\cite{sourceNoRainbow}.
The no rainbow problems asks if there is a surjective node coloring of an $r$-regular multigraph.

Rephrased, the no rainbow problem asks if we can assign each node a color.
In a graph with $r$ nodes per edge -- each edge connects $r$ different nodes.
All $r$ colors should be represented in the entire graph.
No edge should connect all $r$ colors.
A node coloring which satisfies these constraints is a solution to the no rainbow problem.

An edge which connects all $r$ colors is called a rainbow edge -- hence the name of the problem.
The no rainbow problem is a variant of the constraint satisfaction problem.

The no rainbow problem is related to the phylogenetic decisiveness problem. \cite{sourcePhylogeneticDecisiveness}
